Java Script notes 

synatx parser ==> A syntax pareser is a part of javascript engine its reads your code character by character and 
                  tells what your code does and checks if the grammer is correct or not. it translates your code
                  to mechine readable code 

 example => code                                            example => computer instruction 
     
function hello(){                                           function
    var a ='hello aman';                                    variable 

}                 
                  
                                     parsing 
                                       |
                                     grammer checks
                                       |
                                     language

Lexical Environment ==> Means exists in programing languages in which where you write something is important 
                                             or 
                        physical code where you write the code in the programing 

example ==> code 

 function test (){                                         // global level 

 }  
function a (){                                            // global level  
    function b(){                                         // local level

    }
 }                                           

Execution Context ==>  There are lots of Lexical Environment which  one is runing is managed via  exection Context. Its can contion
                       thing beyond what your written in your code 

example ==> function --> Function Execution    Context
                            |        |           |
                         name      code run    statement 

Function test (){
    consale log ('hello aman');
}            
test();
