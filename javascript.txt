Java Script notes 

Conceptual  Aside 

synatx parser ==> A syntax pareser is a part of javascript engine its reads your code character by character and 
                  tells what your code does and checks if the grammer is correct or not. it translates your code
                  to mechine readable code 

 example => code                                            example => computer instruction 
     
function hello(){                                           function
    var a ='hello aman';                                    variable 

}                 
                  
                                     parsing 
                                       |
                                     grammer checks
                                       |
                                     language

Lexical Environment ==> Means exists in programing languages in which where you write something is important 
                                             or 
                        physical code where you write the code in the programing 

example ==> code 

 function test (){                                         // global level 

 }  
function a (){                                            // global level  
    function b(){                                         // local level

    }
 }                                           

Execution Context ==>  There are lots of Lexical Environment which  one is runing is managed via  exection Context. Its can contion
                       thing beyond what your written in your code 

There are Two type of Execution Context

Functio  Execution Context ==> when ever function is invoked the new function Execution Context created . each new unction is own its 
                              execution context which includes local variable,parameter and reference to its Environment

example ==> function --> Function Execution    Context
                            |        |           |
                         name      code run    statement 

Function test (){
    consale log ('hello aman');
}            
test();

Global Execution context ==> when ever the code is run in javascript it's run inside the execution context .Meaning a wrapper that the 
                            javascript engine  wrap that is up, that code that you  written in global execution.


. There will be always a global object in browser in window  each new tab  have  there own global execution context hence  has its 
  own window object 
. in broswer  : window ==  this
  when code is executed in javascript its automaticaly created == this 

example ==>

 var a = 10;
function b() {
    document.write('hello world');
}
a         // 10
window.a  // 10
this.a    // 10   

b();        // hello wolrd
window.b(); 
this.window.b();

in this example hello world is call there time and a has value =10
